## STRAIGHT

__Abstract__

STRAIGHT, a speech analysis, modification synthesis system, is an extension of the classical channel VOCODER that exploits the advantages of progress in information processing technologies and a new conceptualization of the role of repetitive structures in speech sounds. This review outlines historical backgrounds, architecture, underlying principles, and representative applications of STRAIGHT.
